# Employee Performance Analyzer (Python)

This is a simple Python project to **manage and analyze employee performance**.  
It allows adding, viewing, searching, updating, deleting employee records and also identifies **Top 3 performers** based on performance score.  
Data is stored permanently in a **CSV file**, so it is not lost when the program closes.

## 🔧 Features
- Add Employee (ID, Name, Department, Score)
- View All Employees in table format
- Search Employee by **ID** or **Name**
- Update Employee details
- Delete Employee
- Display **Top 3 Performers** by score
- Save & Load data using CSV
- Input validation and duplicate ID prevention
